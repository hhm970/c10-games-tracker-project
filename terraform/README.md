## Description

This folder contains all the terraform files to create all our AWS services.

### The Why
This folder is important because it allows us to quickly and easily create and destroy AWS services. It is a good idea to run scripts remotely on AWS, because they can be self-sufficient and run at set times. It is also useful that they can be easily destroyed, because then we can easily remove them, should we no longer need them.


## Requirements
- ```Terraform```

## Environment Variables
In order to run the scripts you will need the following environment variables in a *terraform.tfvars* file:

- ```DB_PASSWORD```
- ```DB_NAME```
- ```DB_USER```
- ```DB_HOST```
- ```DB_PORT```
- ```GOG_BASE_URL```
- ```EPIC_BASE_URL```
- ```STEAM_BASE_URL```
- ```AWS_KEY```
- ```AWS_SECRET```

## The Scripts
This folder contains the following scripts:

- **database.tf**  
This script creates an RDS database.  
  - **dashboard.tf**
  This script creates an ECS Service which continually deploys the dashboard.
  
- **pipeline_eventbridge.tf**  
This script creates an EventBridge Schedule which triggers every evening at 23:50, and targets the StepFunction that executes the pipeline.  
  
- **pipeline_lambdas.tf**  
This script creates all the Lambda functions which are used in the pipeline StepFunction. 

- **pipeline_stepfunction.tf**  
This script creates a StepFunction that executes the pipeline.
