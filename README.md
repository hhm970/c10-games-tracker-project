# Games Tracker Project ðŸ‘¾
## Description
**This Project is responsible for helping users to keep up with the latest game releases as well as understand the latest gaming trends.**

>New PC games are released every day on different platforms; itâ€™s hard to keep up with new releases, and itâ€™s even harder to understand the trends in gaming. We aim to create a data pipeline that tracks new new releases on major PC platforms. We will also produce a dashboard with key metrics and graphs for comparisons between different websites. Furthermore we will also send email notifications to our subscribers- weekly PDF reports and daily notifications about new releases that day.   

## Data Sources
- `Epic Games` - GraphQL API
- `GOG` - Webscraping
- `Steam` - Webscraping

## Users
- `Gamers` - Know what the latest game releases are.

- `Developers`- Understand the market more effectively and produce games which align with current market trends.

- `Retailers` - Understand latest market trends - use knowledge to know what games to push/recommend to users.
